# Something New Advertising

It's our party policy that parties should disclose their digital advertising in some way.

This is our experiment in doing so. It's early days, and very incomplete. What's here at the moment is a first draft to see how it could be done.

## Help us improve

Feedback is very welcome; create a [new issue](https://github.com/SomethingNewUK/advertising/issues) with your thoughts, and we can all help make it better. Of course, if you want to just go ahead and suggest an improvement directly, pull requests are welcome.
